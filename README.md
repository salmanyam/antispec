# antispec

The purpose of this project is to automatically generate anti-specifications from vulnerable programs. we manually analyzed and annotated more than 130 vulnerabilities in hundreds of vulnerable programs in DARPAâ€™s Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC). Our annotations show the causes of vulnerabilities, identify vulnerable locations, and the impacts of the vulnerabilities on control flow and data flow.
